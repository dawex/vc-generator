# OpenAPI Documentation

## Overview

This project provides a solution for managing OpenAPI documentation efficiently by combining the power of **Redoc** for API visualization and a custom **Vue.js-based interface** for organizing and displaying technical specifications. The resulting documentation is deployed using **GitHub Pages**, enabling easy sharing and collaboration.

By treating documentation like a code project, this setup encourages modularity, scalability, and better collaboration for managing OpenAPI specifications.
